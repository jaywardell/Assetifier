### Assetifier 0.3.0

This is a tool for creating constants from the resources in an XCode Asset Catalog.

Just open an asset catalog with Assetifier, and it will generate a swift file with enums for the images and colors found in the asset catalog.  

You can also choose to add extensions for easily initializing various image and color objects using these constants in many of Apple's APIs.

If you change the asset catalog, simply tap the reload button to get an updated swift file.

Stop using stringly-typed assets like an animal.  Assetifier makes generating constants from your Asset Catalog a one minute process.

I am no graphic designer.  While I feel the icon for this project rightly expresses its philosophy, it is far from ideal aesthetically.  If anyone wanted to offer a better icon, I'd be very appreciative. Just tweet [@jaywardell](https://twitter.com/jaywardell) or submit a pull request, whichever is easier for you.  Thanks. 

Of course, I'll accept any other feedback on this project as well.
